        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Brady Neeb, and I am currently a Senior at Saint Michael's College. I will graduate in May 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor of Mathematics. I played NCAA Division II Lacrosse here for three years, and I am Co-Founder and President of Saint Michael's Backcountry Hunters and Anglers Club Chapter. I am seeking work in the Software industry starting in late summer 2022 after graduation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My time at Saint Michael's College has been spent on perfecting my problem solving skills and developing my passion for technology and development. My expansive coursework and drive for perfection prepares me well to be a valuable asset to any company. I am a very adaptable student that works well in teams. My previous position as an SEO Team Lead further provides me with the necessary skills to succeed in the Software industry. I was hired as an intern in January 2021, and by March 2021, I was promoted to a full time position and I had the opprutunity to manage a team of 4-6 people. I was right hand man to our CEO, and I would meet with her several times a week to discuss strategy and company logistics. Our tasks involved lots of data science, including scripting Python using a variety of libraries. Our other responsibilities included analyzing and improving backend website performance, and making the necessary changes to make our website as robust as possible. I learned a lot about teamwork and leadership while managing people, and I am excited to take these skills to my next professional endevor.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects </h2>
        <p> Here are descriptions of some projects I have worked on in and outside of the classroom. I enjoy applying and expanding my knowledge outside of class, because it gives me an opprutunity to work on new techniques, while further expanding my knowledge in previous ones. I spend a lot of time on YouTube researching and learning some of the newest technology. I enjoy spreading my knowledge into as many facets as possible in technology, and I will continue to do so during my professional career. I beleive that it is important to be a jack of all trades in technology, because there are always new improvements to stay on top of in this ever changing industry. </p>
